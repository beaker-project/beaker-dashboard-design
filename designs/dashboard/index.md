# Main Dashboard

Designs for the landing Dashboard of beaker.

When a regular user authenticates in the Beaker web interface, the first screen shown is a dashboard containing:

- State of the machines in the instance (available, loaned, broken, reserved) as well as a link to systems page
- Current load of jobs/recipies running, with possible historical data
- Available Lab Controllers and queue size for those
- General information or alerts can also be shown
