## System details - General Information

When a user clicks a system in the table presented in the Systems screen, the details for that system are presented.
Clicking the 'x' in the top-right corner of the screen sends the user back to the Systems screen.
A horizontal submenu groups all of the configuration and information for the system by subject.

The first details screen has the general information about the system. It contains 5 cards:
- Ownership: informs who is the owner for this system and if is there any active loan. Also has buttons for borrowing
the system or lending it to someone, given the current user has the proper permissions to do so.

for the system.
- Notes: notes about the system, written by anyone with permissions to do so.

which allows the user to see all the activity for the system.

The recent activity table has 4 fields:

## System details - Power Options

When a user clicks "Power Options" in the horizontal menu, all the information and configuration related to power is
shown in the screen. 

The "Power Control" card will tell if the system power can be controlled remotely and will have buttons to power the
system on and off, reboot it, interrupt and clear netboot.

A table with the 5 most recent power commands is also shown. There is a button for the user to see all of the power
history for the machine. The table has 4 fields:
- Trigger: identifies how the power command was issued
- Action: the command itself

The "Power Settings" card will let the user set the power configuration for the system, as address, protocol, ID, username,

## System details - Permissions

When the "Permissions" option is selected in the horizontal menu, a card is shown with the specific permissions for the
machine. There are two main options: apply the policy according to a previously defined pool or apply a custom policy.

If the custom policy is selected, a default group called "Everyone" is created. More users and/or groups may be added
by clicking an "Add" button.

For every user / group defined in the policy, all specific permissions will be shown with checkboxes. Marking a checkbox
grants the permission and unmarking it removes the permission. Clicking the trash can icon for a user / group removes it
from the policy.

## System details - provisioning

When the "Provisioning" option is selected in the horizontal menu, there will be two cards in the screen.

One of the cards will have the options to provision the system with a specific distro from the library. The user will be
able to select the family, tag, distro and tree as well as a set of Install Options to provision the system. A checkbox
may be selected to reboot the system.

Install Options can be defined in the second card. The "default" set of options will always be available, for all families
and architectures, with specific KS metadata and Kernel options for the installation. The user may click the "Add" button
to create customized sets of options for specific families and / or architectures supported by the system, and edit them
afterwards. Clicking the trash can icon for a set of options excludes it.
