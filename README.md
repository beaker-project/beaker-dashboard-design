# beaker-next-design
This repository holds the proposed design and use cases for the new beaker UI.

Designs are being built in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) using [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) components. The files are under the _sketches folder.

To enable better visualization and understandment of the user interface, the screens and use cases are being exported to [the web version](https://beaker-project.github.io/beaker-next-design/).
